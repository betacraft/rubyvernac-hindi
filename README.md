# Rubyvernac::Hindi


The idea was to enable writing Ruby in various spoken languages. 

I see two benefits to be able to write programmes in mother tongue -

- Those who don't know English, learning programming to understand how computers work would be easier, rather than just mugging English keywords.

- Those who already do programming professionally, but do not have English as their mother tongue, can find writing programming in mother tongue a good exercise to rethink about programming concepts.
